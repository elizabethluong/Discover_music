## Reflections on the Project

In the planning process, we knew we wanted to use Flask as our backend and React as our frontend. The biggest challenge we faced was authorizing the user where we had issues connected the front end login page to authorization.

On reflection we were a bit too ambitious. We initially wanted to have a sentiment analysis, like track functionality, user profile containing information about like tracks and comments. We therefore scaled the project back.
